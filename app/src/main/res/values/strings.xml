    <string name="text_about">Tour Guide App: Is a project developed by: Herbert Rodríguez.\n Is the
        project #6 from the Nanodegree Basic Android Developer at Udacity. \n\n
Tenerife is the chosen city. It is the place where I reside. In this app you can see a small number
        of interesting and very varied sites. \n\n
From the mountain, through the city to the beach and an entertainment area. \n\n

    <string name="elduque_des">Everything we have to say in favor of El Duque Beach is in the image.
                         The beach is located in the municipality of Adeje, in the Southwest, it is
                        390 m long and has one bad thing: it is so beautiful that it gets crowded.</string>
    <string name="teresitas">Las Teresitas</string>
    <string name="teresitas_descr">Las Teresitas beach is three times bigger than El Duque beach (1,300
                        m), it is in the town of San Andrés (municipality of Santa Cruz de Tenerife)
                         and it has a medium degree of occupation, neither high nor low. In its favor,
                        being the Canary Islands so touristy, is the fact that it is not embedded in a
                        marsh of buildings, but isolated. You have to go.</string>
    <string name="gigantes">De los Gigantes\nLocation:Los Gigantes</string>
    <string name="gigantes_desc">Los Gigantes accidentally dispose of themselves between the terms of
                        Buenavista del Norte and Santiago del Teide. Some cliffs open and show inlets
                        and small beaches that are a joy. For example, this one, near Puerto de Los
                        Gigantes: nice, pretty.</string>
